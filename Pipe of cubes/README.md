# Pipe of cubes algorithm

## The challenge is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3.

## Being given m, which is the total building volume, find the number n of cubes.

## The parameter of the function findNb (find_nb, find-nb, findNb, ...) will be an integer m and you have to return the integer n such as n^3 + (n-1)^3 + ... + 1^3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.

It is a Code Wars challenge. By solving it, I could practise algorithm resolution. Although it was easier than ..., I still see it as a valuable challenge.
