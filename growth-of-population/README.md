# Growth of Population algorithm

## Write a function nbYear(p0, percent, aug, p) that should return the number of years necessary to make the population (p0) greater of equal then the surpass population (p). Also, aug is an integer, which determines how many new inhabitants come or leave the population; percent is a positive or null floating number, which determines the population grow; p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)

It is a Code Wars challenge. By solving it, I could practise algorithm resolution. Although it was an easy-to-be-solved algorithm, I still see it as a valuable challenge.
